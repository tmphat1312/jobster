# Jobster React CRUD Practice

This project is a practice exercise for learning ReactJS with basic **CRUD** and **auth** functionalities. It was created along with tutorials in the Udemy course [React 18 Tutorial and Projects Course (2023)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-tutorial-and-projects-course/?referralCode=FEE6A921AF07E2563CEF) which I bought with discount üòè.

## Introduction
Nothing wrong to follow some tutorials to make a web app, right? üòÅ
I would say that I didn't do what `John` do in the course, I've added more to make it more attractive to keep me going.
I learned a lot from this course and outside of it.Notably, I struggled to work around with `any` type in `Typescript` it was not fun at all, but my friends I made it through. I'm still learning and I'm not going to stop. I'm going to keep going and going and going

## Features

This project includes the following features:

- Login, register and logout are just for practical project, they are not secure.
- Create, read, update, and delete job listings.
- I made a simple pagination on the job listing page.
- Filter job listings by `position`, `status`, `job type`.
- Sort job listings by `date` added or `name`.
- Visualize job listings with `area`, `bar`, and `line` charts to test it out you need to login as a test user with `email:testUser@test.com password:secret` or hit the `live demo` button
- HAHA, I did make a edit form modal to edit a job. I'm so proud of myself üòÅ
- Note that the api is not mine, I was provided by `John` in the course. So some functionalities are not working as I expected (I couldn't do anything HuHu üò≠)
